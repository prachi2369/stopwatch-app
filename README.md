# Stopwatch App

## Overview

This project is a fully functional **Stopwatch Application** built with React. The app allows users to start, pause, stop, and reset the stopwatch with precision up to milliseconds. The design ensures responsiveness and accessibility, making it user-friendly on both mobile and desktop platforms.

## Features

1. **Start, Pause, Resume Functionality**
   - Users can easily start and pause the timer with clear visual indicators for when the stopwatch is running or paused.
   - The stopwatch runs with millisecond precision, updating every 10 milliseconds.

2. **Stop and Reset**
   - Users can stop the timer and view the final elapsed time before resetting the stopwatch back to zero.
   - Reset clears both the time and any final recorded time.

3. **Responsive and Dynamic Layout**
   - The UI is designed to be fully responsive across various screen sizes and devices.
   - The layout dynamically adjusts without using static widths, allowing flexibility across different viewports.

4. **Reusable Components**
   - Components like `TimerDisplay`, `FinalTimeDisplay`, and `ControlPanel` are modular and reusable.
   - Icons from FontAwesome are used for a clean and modern control panel interface.

5. **Optimized Performance**
   - The `useCallback` and `useRef` hooks are used to ensure optimal performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - The stopwatch functions accurately even when paused or resumed.

6. **CSS Styling and Theming**
   - The application uses modern CSS techniques like flexbox to align and center elements.
   - Variables (`--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`) are used for easy theme management and customization.

## Technologies Used

- **React (Hooks)**
  - React was used to build the interactive and dynamic user interface.
  - Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` were implemented for managing state and performance.

- **FontAwesome**
  - FontAwesome icons are integrated for the stopwatch controls, providing a sleek user experience.

- **CSS Flexbox**
  - Flexbox was used to ensure that the layout is flexible and responsive, avoiding fixed sizes and hardcoded widths.
